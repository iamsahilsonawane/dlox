Things that I personally may want to implement.
But maybe i'll do this in the more optimised c version. 

- [ ] `continue` keyword support for loops. Maybe we'll not want to add for as a sync sugar, but as a manual implementation.
- [ ] The `print` shouldn't be a built-in keyword, but a foreign function.
- [ ] (BIG COMMITMENT) Support for *foreign functions interface* - ability for devs to add native language functions if needed (dart/c depending on what i choose to implement this on eventually)
